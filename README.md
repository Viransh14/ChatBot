🚨 The Problem: A Crisis of Trust in Health Information
80% of adults seek health answers online, but face an “infodemic” of misinformation.
During outbreaks, 87% of public health content online can be false.
This leads to delayed treatment, poor choices, panic, and healthcare system overload.

💡 Our Solution: InfoMed AI

✅ Interactive – Simple, conversational interface for clear answers.
✅ Intelligent – Knowledge graph maps symptoms, conditions, and safe next steps.
✅ Optimized – Continuous monitoring ensures peak accuracy and relevance.

🛠️ How It Works
Verified Data Ingestion – Exclusively from global health authorities.
Intelligent Knowledge Graph – Maps medical insights into actionable guidance.
Conversational Interface – Accessible, user-friendly Q&A chatbot.
Continuous Optimization – Model updates to maintain reliability.
