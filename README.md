# ChatBot
AI-Driven Public Health Chatbot for Disease Awareness:
üí° Introduction
This project is an AI-powered chatbot developed for the DATAQUEST 2.0 Hackathon. Its primary goal is to combat health misinformation and provide accessible, accurate, and personalized public health information.

üòü The Problem
A major challenge in public health is the widespread lack of access to reliable and up-to-date health information. This issue is magnified during disease outbreaks by a surge of misinformation, which can lead to public confusion, panic, and actions that worsen the spread of illness.

Current health resources often have several limitations:

Difficult to Navigate: Information can be scattered and complex for the average person to understand.

Limited Availability: They are not always available 24/7 for immediate concerns.

Lack of Personalization: They cannot provide tailored guidance based on individual symptoms or questions.

This gap can lead to delayed or inappropriate care-seeking, placing a significant strain on healthcare systems.

‚ú® Our Solution
To address these challenges, we have developed an AI-driven chatbot that serves as a reliable, first-line source of health information. Our solution is built on the following principles:

Collect Accurate Data: We gather health information exclusively from trusted and verified sources, such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Build an Intelligent AI Model: The core of our chatbot is an AI model trained on the collected data. It is designed to understand natural language questions and provide clear, correct answers.

Develop a Comprehensive Knowledge Base: We created a structured knowledge base that maps symptoms to potential diseases and recommends appropriate actions, guiding the chatbot's responses and ensuring the information is actionable.

Create a User-Friendly Interface: The chatbot is accessible through a simple and intuitive chat interface, making it easy for anyone to ask questions and receive instant answers.

Deploy and Monitor: The chatbot is designed for continuous monitoring and improvement to ensure its accuracy and helpfulness over time.

üöÄ Key Features
24/7 Availability: Get health information anytime, anywhere.

Symptom Checker: Describe your symptoms and get information about potential conditions.

Disease Information: Ask about specific diseases, their symptoms, prevention methods, and treatment options.

Misinformation Debunking: Verify rumors and get facts from reliable sources.

Personalized Guidance: Receive tailored advice based on your queries.

User-Friendly: Simple and intuitive chat interface requires no technical skills.

üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Backend: Python, Flask
